## Simple and Accurate Resistor Calculator

This Python-based **Resistor Calculator**, developed using the Tkinter library, provides an efficient way to calculate the resistance of **4-band**, **5-band**, and **6-band** resistors. It was designed during my time as a Computer Engineering student, and the tool simplifies resistor value determination by taking the band colors as input and accurately calculating the corresponding resistance.

Whether for academic purposes or quick reference in projects, this calculator offers ease of use with a clean interface and reliable performance.

## Tech Stack & Explanation

During my studies as a Computer Engineering student, I created this **Resistor Calculator** using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI).

The application allows users to calculate the resistance of **4-band**, **5-band**, and **6-band** resistors by selecting the corresponding color codes. 

- **Why Python?** I chose Python for its simplicity.
- **Why Tkinter?** Tkinter provides an easy way to build graphical user interfaces in Python.
- **App Logic:** The logic of the app follows the standard resistor color codes and formulas.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in Python programming, GUI design, and translating technical engineering concepts into a functional tool.

## Project Insights

This project allowed me to merge my knowledge of electronics and programming. One of the most fulfilling aspects was developing the **Resistor Calculator** as a practical application of my studies.

**Future Improvements:**
- Expanding the calculator to support more advanced resistor types.
- Integrating it with a microcontroller for real-time measurement, making the tool even more powerful.

Overall, this project deepened my understanding of both hardware and software, and it was rewarding to create a tool directly relevant to my Computer Engineering studies.
